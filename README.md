1. Grade - gets number of bulls and cows

2. Generated Code - parent class for code generation

3. Impossible code - creates code with a-z, 0-9

4. SecretCode - creates code with only 0-9

5. PseudoCode - creates code with 0-9 using System.nanoTime()


>Created for Java track project from Hyperskill.
